# QA Automation Portfolio

##  About Me

QA Analyst with 10+ years of experience in software quality assurance, specializing in **manual testing with hands-on automation support**. This repository reflects my real-world QA experience across web applications, APIs, data validation, and test automation using **Playwright, Cypress, Python, and Java**.

My focus is on **building quality into products early**, validating business requirements thoroughly, and using automation strategically to support regression and repeatable testing.

What This Repository Demonstrates

* Strong **manual QA foundations** aligned with SDLC/STLC
* Practical, hands-on **test automation examples** (not tutorials)
* UI, functional, regression, and basic API validation coverage
* Clean, readable test code suitable for team environments
* Tooling commonly used in Agile/Scrum teams

This portfolio directly supports the experience listed on my **resume and LinkedIn profile**.
