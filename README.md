# QA Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Automation Portfolio!  
I am a QA Analyst with **10+ years of experience** in manual and automation testing. This portfolio showcases my hands-on work in:

- **Playwright & Cypress** (UI automation, regression testing, cross-browser testing)
- **Python scripts** (functional automation and input validation)
- **Java automation** (test data generation)

## Projects

### 1. Playwright Automation
- `example.spec.ts`, `fixture.spec.ts`, `testbyrow.spec.ts`
- Automated UI workflows for web applications
- Demonstrates browser fixtures, page creation, and element assertions

### 2. Cypress Automation
- `cypress_tests.spec.js`
- UI and regression testing across multiple browsers
- Includes automated API validation

### 3. Python Automation Scripts
- `compound_interest.py`
- Validates input fields and calculates compound interest
- Includes reusable functions for automation testing

### 4. Java Automation Scripts
- `TestDataGenerator.java`
- Generates unique email addresses for test automation
- Uses timestamp-based formatting for consistent and safe test data
