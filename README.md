This repository contains sample automation tests I have created
using Playwright and Cypress. Tests demonstrate:

- UI navigation and interactions
- API testing
- Role-based selectors and assertions
- Cross-browser and regression testing scenarios

## Tools
- Playwright
- Cypress
- Postman (for API tests)

## Notes
These tests are examples of my automation work and can be run locally
following the standard framework setup instructions.
